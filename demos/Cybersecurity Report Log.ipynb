    "\n",
    "- **Framework**: Yera (Python-based AI agent orchestration)\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Extract technical indicators, MITRE techniques, and recommended actions from threat reports\n",
    "- **Output**: Structured `ThreatReport` objects with validated schemas\n",

    "\n",
    "- Comprehensive extraction of technical indicators (IPs, domains, file hashes, URLs)\n",
    "- MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping\n",
    "- Validation and type safety using Pydantic-style models\n",

    "1. **Did I extract EVERY technical indicator mentioned?** (domains, IPs, URLs, hashes, file paths)\n",
    "2. **Did I avoid hallucinating MITRE tactics if they weren't explicitly stated?**\n",
    "3. **Did I extract the email date from the header?**\n",
    "4. **Are all technical indicators exact copies from the document?**\n",
    "5. **Did I check for target/sector information in descriptive text?**\n",
    "6. **Would another analyst extract the same information?**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario 1**: Email lists \"T1566.002 - Phishing: Spearphishing Link\" without mentioning tactics\n",
    "-> Extract with `tactic: None`, `technique_id: \"T1566.002\"`, `technique_name: \"Phishing: Spearphishing Link\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario 2**: Document shows defanged domain: \"malicious[.]com\"\n",
    "-> Extract exactly as: `indicator_type: \"Domain\"`, `value: \"malicious[.]com\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario 3**: Document lists IPs, domains, URLs, and hashes\n",
    "-> Create TechnicalIndicator entries for EACH ONE with appropriate type\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario 4**: Email says \"targeting finance teams\"\n",
    "-> Extract `sector: \"finance\"` or `sector: \"finance teams\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario 5**: Email subject says \"URGENT\" but doesn't specify threat level\n",
    "-> Set `threat_level: None` (don't infer \"CRITICAL\" from \"URGENT\")\n",

      "### Recommended Actions - CATEGORY RULES\n",
      "CRITICAL: Each action should appear in ONLY ONE category (no duplicates)\n",
      "\n",
      "- **immediate_actions**: Urgent tasks for next 24-48 hours\n",
      "  Triggers: \"warn\", \"alert\", \"immediately\", \"urgent\", \"now\"\n",
      "  Example: \"warn your finance team\"\n",
      "\n",
      "- **short_term_actions**: Tasks for next 1-2 weeks\n",
      "  Triggers: \"review\", \"update\", \"implement\", \"next 7 days\", \"short-term\"\n",
      "  Example: \"Update email filtering rules to block sender domains\"\n",
      "\n",
      "- **long_term_initiatives**: Strategic/ongoing initiatives\n",
      "  Triggers: \"strategy\", \"program\", \"long-term\", \"develop\", \"establish\"\n",
      "  Example: \"Implement security awareness training program\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Each action should be a complete sentence or bullet point as written in the document.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Document Type Handling\n",
      "\n",
      "### Email Format\n",
      "- **Date extraction**: Look for \"Date:\" in email header\n",
      "- **Sender**: Extract from \"From:\" field\n",
      "- **Subject**: Extract from \"Subject:\" field\n",
      "- **Target/Sector**: Look for phrases like \"targeting X teams\", \"affecting Y sector\"\n",
      "- **Indicators**: Often appear in bulleted sections or labeled lists\n",
      "- **MITRE techniques**: Often listed with just IDs and names, rarely with tactics in informal emails\n",
      "- **Date extraction**: ALWAYS check email headers for \"Date:\" field\n",
      "  Example: \"Date: January 1, 2026 7:21 PM\" → report_date: \"January 1, 2026 7:21 PM\"\n",
      "- Extract date from email header \"Date:\" field  # (existing line)\n",
      "- Look for threat level in subject line or opening paragraphs\n",
      "- Case studies often appear as numbered or titled sections\n",
      "\n",
      "### PDF/Word Reports\n",
      "- Check executive summary for high-level metrics\n",
      "- Look for tables for country overviews and IOCs\n",
      "- MITRE ATT&CK information often appears in dedicated sections with full tactic/technique/procedure details\n",
      "\n",
      "## Quality Checks\n",
      "\n",
      "Before finalizing extraction:\n",
      "1. **Did I extract EVERY technical indicator mentioned?** (domains, IPs, URLs, hashes, file paths)\n",
      "2. **Did I avoid hallucinating MITRE tactics if they weren't explicitly stated?**\n",
      "3. **Did I extract the email date from the header?**\n",
      "4. **Are all technical indicators exact copies from the document?**\n",
      "5. **Did I check for target/sector information in descriptive text?**\n",
      "6. **Would another analyst extract the same information?**\n",
      "\n",
      "## Example Scenarios\n",
      "\n",
      "**Scenario 1**: Email lists \"T1566.002 - Phishing: Spearphishing Link\" without mentioning tactics\n",
      "-> Extract with `tactic: None`, `technique_id: \"T1566.002\"`, `technique_name: \"Phishing: Spearphishing Link\"`\n",
      "\n",
      "**Scenario 2**: Document shows defanged domain: \"malicious[.]com\"\n",
      "-> Extract exactly as: `indicator_type: \"Domain\"`, `value: \"malicious[.]com\"`\n",
      "\n",
      "**Scenario 3**: Document lists IPs, domains, URLs, and hashes\n",
      "-> Create TechnicalIndicator entries for EACH ONE with appropriate type\n",
      "\n",
      "**Scenario 4**: Email says \"targeting finance teams\"\n",
      "-> Extract `sector: \"finance\"` or `sector: \"finance teams\"`\n",
      "\n",
      "**Scenario 5**: Email subject says \"URGENT\" but doesn't specify threat level\n",
      "-> Set `threat_level: None` (don't infer \"CRITICAL\" from \"URGENT\")\n",
      "\n",
      "## Output Format\n",
      "\n",
      "Return the extracted information as a valid ThreatReport object. All fields follow the structure defined in your schema. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Remember**: \n",
      "- Extract EVERY indicator (domains, IPs, URLs, hashes, paths)\n",
      "- NEVER hallucinate MITRE tactics\n",
      "- Accuracy over completeness\n",
      "\n",
