    "\n",
    "**Knowledge graphs** represent information as entities (nodes) and their relationships (edges). For example, in \"Apple acquired Beats in 2014\", we'd extract entities like `Apple (Organisation)` and `Beats (Organization)` with a relationship `acquired`. This structured format makes it easy to query, visualize, and reason about complex information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structured generation** ensures LLM outputs match a specific schema. Instead of parsing freeform text (which is error-prone!), we define Python classes and Yera guarantees the LLM returns valid instances. This is perfect for extracting structured data from unstructured text.\n",

      "ENTITY TYPES:\n",
      "- Use single-word types that fit the domain (e.g., Person, Organization, \n",
      "Location, Species, Breed, Product, etc.)\n",
      "- Common types: Person, Organization, Location, Event, Concept, Law\n",
      "- Be specific when relevant: \"Cat\" instead of just \"Animal\"\n",
      "- Always use PascalCase or snake_case (no spaces)\n",

      "RELATIONSHIP RULES:\n",
      "1. Direction matters - think carefully about who/what is the SUBJECT and OBJECT:\n",
      "   - CORRECT: John_Smith -> father_of -> Jane_Smith (John IS the father)\n",
      "   - WRONG: Jane_Smith -> father_of -> John_Smith\n",

      "   - AVOID: \"worship_of\" (ambiguous direction)\n",

      "3. NO bidirectional relationships unless truly symmetric:\n",
      "   - \"married_to\" ✓ (symmetric)\n",

      "   - \"destroyed\" / \"destroyed_by\" ✗ (choose ONE direction)\n",

      "4. Only extract relationships explicitly stated or strongly implied in the text\n",
      "5. Each entity should have 1-3 key relationships (not exhaustive)\n",
      "6. Each entity should appear ONCE in the output\n",
      "\n",
      "EXTRACTION RULES:\n",
      "- Extract 5-15 most important entities (NO DUPLICATES)\n",

      "- Keep entity names concise (no descriptions in the name field)\n",
