Night City's mayor, Lucius Rhyne, announced today that Arasaka Corporation has been awarded a controversial contract to deploy advanced neural surveillance systems across Watson District, sparking protests from local fixers and the Mox gang leadership.

The deal, valued at 500 million eurodollars, will see Arasaka install their proprietary Soulkiller-derived monitoring technology throughout Northside and Kabuki neighborhoods. Biotechnica, Arasaka's main competitor in the neural tech sector, has filed a complaint with the NCPD alleging bid manipulation.

V, a prominent mercenary working with fixers throughout Night City, told local netrunner news outlet N54 that the surveillance rollout "threatens the operational security of independent contractors across Watson." V has been known to work closely with Judy Alvarez, a talented braindance technician formerly employed by Clouds, the doll house operated by the Tyger Claws in Japantown.

Panam Palmer, a former member of the Aldecaldos nomad clan who now leads a splinter faction based in the Badlands, expressed concerns that Arasaka's expanded presence could threaten nomad trade routes. "Arasaka already controls most of City Center and Corpo Plaza," Palmer stated. "Now they're pushing into territories traditionally managed by Militech."

The Voodoo Boys, a netrunner gang operating primarily from Pacifica's Batty's Hotel, have reportedly begun coordinating with the Mox to develop countermeasures against the surveillance infrastructure. Placide, the gang's operations leader, declined to comment on these allegations.

Jackie Welles, a well-known solo who died under mysterious circumstances last year during a heist at Konpeki Plaza, had previously warned associates about Arasaka's surveillance capabilities. His former partner Viktor Vektor, a ripperdoc operating a clinic in Watson's Little China district, maintains that corporate overreach was responsible for Welles' death.

Dexter DeShawn, a fixer who disappeared following the Konpeki Plaza incident, had brokered the original heist job that targeted an Arasaka Relic prototype. The Relic, developed by Arasaka's Special Programs division, was reportedly stolen from Yorinobu Arasaka, son of Arasaka's CEO Saburo Arasaka.

Saburo Arasaka, who is 158 years old and relies on extensive life-extension technology developed by Arasaka's medical division, oversees the corporation from Tokyo. His daughter Hanako Arasaka serves as the head of Arasaka's North American operations based in Night City.

Meanwhile, Johnny Silverhand, the legendary rockerboy who died in 2023 during an attack on Arasaka Tower, has become a symbol for anti-corporate resistance. Alt Cunningham, Silverhand's former girlfriend and the netrunner who originally created the Soulkiller program before being kidnapped by Arasaka, remains a mythical figure among Night City's netrunner community.

Misty Olszewski, proprietor of Misty's Esoterica shop in Watson and Welles' former girlfriend, has organized community meetings to discuss resistance strategies. She works closely with Padre, a fixer operating from the Glen who maintains connections with Valentinos gang members throughout Heywood.

The NCPD, largely funded by corporate security contracts from both Arasaka and Militech, has announced they will not interfere with the surveillance installation. River Ward, a former NCPD detective who resigned last month citing corruption concerns, told reporters that "the line between NCPD and corporate security hasn't existed for years."

Wakako Okada, a powerful fixer in Japantown with deep ties to both Arasaka and the Tyger Claws, brokered several of the subcontracts for the surveillance project. She maintains her operations from her pachinko parlor, which serves as a front for her extensive information brokerage network.

Regina Jones, a fixer specializing in corporate intelligence and operating primarily in Watson, has reportedly been hiring netrunners to assess vulnerabilities in the new surveillance systems. She previously worked as a media correspondent before transitioning to the fixer trade.

Rogue Amendiares, owner of the Afterlife bar in City Center and Night City's most legendary fixer, stated that "corporate surveillance is bad for business" and hinted at coordinated action from the city's fixer network. She worked alongside Silverhand during the 2023 Arasaka Tower assault and survived the corporate counterstrike.

Goro Takemura, a former bodyguard to Saburo Arasaka who went rogue following his employer's death, has not been seen in Night City for several months. Sources suggest he may be working with anti-Arasaka elements within the corporation itself.

The situation remains volatile as multiple factions position themselves in response to Arasaka's expanding surveillance infrastructure across Night City's districts.
