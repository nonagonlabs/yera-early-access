MIDDLE-EARTH DAILY
Breaking: Council Forms Alliance Against Rising Darkness
RIVENDELL — In an unprecedented gathering at the House of Elrond, representatives from across Middle-earth convened yesterday to address mounting threats from Mordor. The meeting, attended by leaders from multiple races, resulted in the formation of a coalition tasked with destroying the One Ring.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn and heir to the throne of Gondor, pledged his sword to the mission alongside his longtime friend and mentor Gandalf the Grey. The wizard, who serves as advisor to several kingdoms, warned attendees that Dark Lord Sauron has been rebuilding his forces in Mordor.
The hobbit Frodo Baggins, nephew of the renowned Bilbo Baggins, volunteered to carry the Ring despite its corrupting influence. He will be accompanied by his loyal gardener Samwise Gamgee, as well as cousins Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took. Bilbo, now residing in Rivendell under Elrond's hospitality, expressed both pride and concern for his nephew's dangerous undertaking.
Gimli, son of Glóin, represented the Dwarves of Erebor, while Legolas, son of King Thranduil, spoke for the Woodland Elves of Mirkwood. Despite historical tensions between their peoples, both warriors agreed to join the quest. Boromir, eldest son of Denethor, Steward of Gondor and brother to Faramir, also committed to the fellowship, though he expressed reservations about the destruction plan.
Elrond, who once fought alongside High King Gil-galad against Sauron's predecessor, noted that his daughter Arwen supports the alliance despite her father's concerns. Galadriel, Lady of Lothlórien and wife of Celeborn, sent word of her support through her granddaughter's betrothed, Aragorn.
Meanwhile, reports indicate that the traitorous wizard Saruman, formerly Gandalf's superior in the Istari order, has allied with Sauron from his tower of Isengard. Intelligence suggests Gríma Wormtongue, advisor to King Théoden of Rohan, may be working as Saruman's agent.
The fellowship departs at dawn.
